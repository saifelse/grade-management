The grade management system was originally written by Rich Chan,
and modified by Oscar Moll.

The software uses Google Docs as the database, whose structure I will
later document.

It is intended that the project be cleaned up. However, ultimately
it will be replaced by a more sophisticated system.

TODOs
=========

Database
--------
Grades will be stored in a sql/sqlite database... this allows for easy backup, more granular permissions, and is much cleaner than Google Docs.

Grade Generator
---------------
This will still be in Java, but it will use the database instead of downloading Google Docs.

Build System
-------------
Using Make: this will allow anyone to use the grade management system fairly easily.

  make jar: compiles the java code into a jar.
  make backup: back up the database with a timestamp
  make stats: generates histograms (should be able to specify target)
  make reports: generates (private) grade files.
  make publish: move reports to online accessible page.
  make clean: deletes all generated files



Switch from SHTML to PHP?
-------------------------
SHTML only allows server-side includes. Being able to include a student's grade report based on a certificate is very hacky. PHP offers server-side includes as well as more functionality that makes this task very easy.

Maybe we can also take a second to do some CSS styling on the website :D
